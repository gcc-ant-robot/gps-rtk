## Desirable Measurements / Experiments
1. Record location of a rover placed at a known physical location on several different days.  Quantify in a N color scatter plot for N different days what the position of the rover appears to be. 
2. Measure range of Base Station to Rover (how far can you walk away from the base station until you loose your DGNSS fix
3. Measure relative distances repeatedly. (If you walk 47‚Äù away from starting point, where does the receiver think you walked?).  You want to test the relative accuracy of the system.
